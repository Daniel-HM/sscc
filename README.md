# Scanner

<sub>Scanner app for product and SSCC barcodes</sub>\
<sub>Uses QuaggaJs to scan EAN13 or SSCC barcodes and react appropriately</sub>

## SSCC
Show contents and amounts of pallet by scanning the SSCC label.

## EAN13
This needs some expanding as the only products entered into the database are the ones imported from packing slips.\
Show product info:
- Name
- Category
- Etc





# TODO
- [ ] More logging
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Actually creating a UI - ugly as sin right now
- [ ] Dashboard with several metrics (average # of products/pallet, products/week, etc)
- [ ] Hopefully optimize the way data is imported from .csv - needs way less queries..
